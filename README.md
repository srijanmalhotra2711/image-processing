# image-processing
The project deals with enhancing the raw image step by step in order to highlight small details, which otherwise were not visible and can prove to be helpful. Image enhancement techniques are used to emphasize and sharpen image features such as to obtain a visually more pleasant, more detailed, or less noisy output image.

Image enhancement is the process of applying these techniques to facilitate  the development of a solution to a Digital imaging problem. The various     techniques that we will be using in the process are:
•	Sharpening and Smoothening
•	Edge detection
•	Bit plane slicing
•	Contrast stretching
•	DCT
•	DFT
•	IDCT
•	Dilation
